Highschool Sports?
</h1>
<p>
Growing up I loved the game of basketball. I played rec league basketball to I couldn't play for them no more. I disliked <strong>football</strong> so that's why I never played in peewee but once. I didn't like it so i pursued the dream of basketball and thought I was going to be the man of basketball coming in 6th grand. I was known as a great shooter in basketball but, I went to tryouts and didn't make the team that year so I moved to football. Played football from 7th to my 12th grade year. I loved it when I made it to highschool. I was the man that played varsity from my freshman year all the way up. I was a stud player on the field , my positions were middle linebacker. I was a hard hitter on the field. I recieved the following rewards my senior ending year coming off an ACL injury:
