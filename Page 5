I was born on April 22, 2003 so I am the age of 19 now and now in college. I am a IT Engineering major of The University Of Missouri and is pursing my dreams to be the best that came through. I want to be rich before I graduate but that is going to come from being a youtuber with my brother. We will reach the top soon and you that reading this <strong>right now</strong> heard it here first. I have dreams and visuals of doing it so we are going to do it and we're going to do it right. One video will blow up and we will take off on everyone. It will be <i>sooner than sooner</i> and I want you as the reader to know that. A couple quotes I will like to share with you guys describes my mentality,<strong>“Greatness is sifted through the grind, therefore don't despise the hard work now for surely it will be worth it in the end.”</strong>
